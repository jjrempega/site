  <h1>Jack Rempega</h1>
  <p>My name is <strong> Jack Rempega</strong> , and this is the first website i have built as
    a part of my learning to become a Full stack web developer. I have chosen to
    persue this path as i have always wanted to know more about coding and what I
    could do to become a full time coder. i have always been fascinated by the
    inner and outer workings of websites and the internet as a whole.
